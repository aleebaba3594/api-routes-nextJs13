in app>api folder make a folder name by which we want to make route, after making the 
folder(with naming convention),we make route.ts in that folder.


--> for nested routing we do the same inside of that folder we make another folder and 
    in that folder we also have to make route.ts
 example 
-->app>api>route1>route2
   route1 and route 2, both contains the route.ts files.

   after getting the request we will return response like
   return new Response('Hello, Next.js!')
-->but if we want to send json object we send response like this.
  return NextResponse.json({ hello: 'Next.js' })
we also have to import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

by getting id or etc we have to make [id] folder name and inside it route.ts
if we have to get multipe data from params we make folder like this

[...id] folder name

in this folder make route.ts and log the params
we can get multiple data but the name used in [...id] foldet and params.id must be same
params.id[0],params.id[1] 
like this we can get multiple data
